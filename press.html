In the spring of my senior year of high school I was approved by Central Oregon Daily to be a part of their Pandemic Profiles editorials. This was a collection of press interviews with non-traditional students.

My Central Oregon Daily story got the attention of the long running daily newspaper the Bend Bulletin. In July of 2021 I did a sit down interview with Zach Demars which was published later that month.

This interview led to an hour long virtual public hall forum with long term associates Steven Weatherald and Eliza Wilson. This Form was held by the City Club of Bend, an association of business owners and public officials.
